"""Render the small glyphs the HTML mail needs, as PNG.

Mail is not the browser. Gmail strips inline ``<svg>`` outright, so a glyph
that is one line of markup in the interface has to arrive as a raster image
attached to the message. This script is the bridge, and it exists as a script
rather than as a one-off so the asset can be regenerated when the drawing or
the colour changes — a binary in a repository nobody can rebuild is a fact
without a source.

**The drawing is the application's own.** ``docs/data-sources.md`` records that
the copy, delete, pencil and chevron glyphs are hand-written paths in the
shared icon module; this takes the copy glyph from
``frontend/src/components/icons.tsx`` verbatim, so the mail and the
interface show one drawing and there is no third-party licence to carry into
the mail.

**The colour is a compromise, deliberately.** Gmail's dark mode inverts the
card behind this icon but never the icon itself, so a glyph drawn in the text
colour disappears on exactly the phone the request came from. Slate 500 is the
template's own secondary colour and holds about 4:1 against the light card and
about 3:1 against Gmail's dark one — not beautiful on either, legible on both,
which for an icon that only has to be recognised is the right trade.
