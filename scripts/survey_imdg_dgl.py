"""A survey of the Dangerous Goods List in the 42-24 document.

This is the first of two steps and deliberately records nothing. The list covers
some 170 pages with eighteen columns, and a parser that silently reads one column
wrong is more dangerous than no parser at all: then there are 2,300 substances
with the wrong segregation code in the app without anybody noticing. So measure
first:

1. Where exactly does the list begin and end?
2. Where are the column boundaries? Those are derived from the x positions of the
   heading and checked against the x positions of the data itself.
3. Which UN numbers does the list yield, and how does that compare with the 2,336
   numbers we currently know from the 41-22 UN cards? Every difference is a
   clue: a missed page, a row laid out differently, or a real change in 42-24.

The earlier probe reported that UN 1361, 3551 and 3560 were missing while there
were gaps in the page range at p734 and p757. Those three are precisely 42-24
changes, so that points to a reading error rather than to missing data; this
survey has to settle it.

Runs via GitHub Actions, because the development environment has no outbound
network. What ends up in the repo in the end is derived data, never the
regulatory text.
