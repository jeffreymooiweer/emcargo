# Configuration

EMCargo is configured through environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and
adjust what you need — every setting has a working default, including the signing key,
which the application makes for itself.

## Two places, and which one wins

Since v1.45.0 some of these settings also appear on the **Settings** screen, in a section
only administrators see. The rule is simple:

- An environment variable is the **starting value**. An installation that never opens the
  settings screen behaves exactly as its `.env` says, on this version and on every
  version before it.
- A value **saved on the settings screen** takes precedence from then on, and takes effect
  without restarting the container.

Only the settings in the table below have a screen counterpart. Everything else — the
signing key, the data folder, the cookie flags, the proxy headers — stays environment-only,
because those are read while the application is starting and there is no screen yet.

| Environment variable | On the settings screen | Takes effect |
|---|---|---|
| `GEO_ADDRESS_API_URL` | Address API | immediately |
| `GEO_ADDRESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Timeout | immediately |
| `ADDRESS_LOOKUP_ENABLED` | Address lookup on/off | immediately |
| `CATALOG_AUTO_SYNC` | Update the catalogue at startup | next restart |
| `UPDATE_CHECK_ENABLED` | Check for updates | immediately |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | Session lifetime | at the next login |
| `UN_CARDS_ENABLED` | Offer UN cards | immediately |
| `CARD_LINKS_ENABLED` | QR code with UN cards on documents | immediately |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | The address this installation is reached on | immediately |
| `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`, `DEFAULT_THEME` | Default language and theme for new users | at their next sign-in |
| — | Organisation name and address | immediately |
| `BRAND_NAME` | The name on the door (header, sign-in page, browser tab) | immediately |
| `SMTP_HOST` and friends | Mail server | immediately |
| `EMCARGO_HISTORY` (starting value only, see below) | Keep shipments (history) | immediately |
| — | Audit log retention | at the next start |

The screen also carries per-user preferences — language, theme, the consignor details that
are retyped on every shipment, a saved signature. Those belong to the account rather than
to the installation, and are described in the [user guide](user-guide.md#settings).

## Sign-in is required

EMCargo has one full application. Every user signs in; administrators manage
accounts, settings and access. The public QR links to UN cards remain the
explicit exception, enabled separately under Settings / UN cards.

`EMCARGO_MODE` has been retired. Remove it from existing deployment files;
leaving `EMCARGO_MODE=open` in an old environment cannot restore guest access.
A former open installation needs an administrator: preserve its data volume and
set `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` before upgrading. Existing
accounts and saved settings are retained. Without an administrator, the sign-in
screen explains the required configuration; there is no anonymous fallback.

There is no scheduled database reset. A future demonstration installation can
use its own accounts and data volume without changing the main installation.

## Shipment history

The history is a setting on the screen: **Settings → Administration → Keep shipments**,
for administrators. Off by default.

| Variable | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `EMCARGO_HISTORY` | The *starting value* of that setting, for installations that set it before v1.188.0. Read until an administrator saves the Administration screen, ignored from then on. New installations need not set it. | `false` |

`EMCARGO_HISTORY_DISCARD` is gone: the application no longer refuses to start over a
switched-off history. Switching off happens on the screen, and the screen deletes first
(below).

Off, a shipment drawn up is a shipment forgotten — the promise every installation made
until v1.173.0 and still makes by default. On, the export step keeps each shipment when
its documents are downloaded (or when the user presses **Keep in history**), and a
**Shipments** page lists them with filters, offers the documents again, opens a shipment
back in the wizard, and removes one. Who sees which is decided by **departments**
(v1.174.0), managed on the users page: a user sees their own department's shipments, a
user without a department sees the unassigned ones, an administrator sees all. An
organisation that never makes a department keeps the plain rule: everybody sees everything.
The switch also brings an **address book** on the details step (v1.176.0), shared by
everyone, **Use as template** on a kept shipment, and the **DGSA annual report**
(v1.177.0): the safety adviser's yearly figures of ADR 1.8.3.3, counted over the kept
shipments of one year and downloadable as a workbook, and since v1.179.0 the report
itself in the shape of the DVSA template, filled in by the adviser, kept per year and
drawn as a PDF on the installation's paper. The **articles library** (v1.180.0) — your own
article codes linked to UN number, names and packaging, picked onto a goods line — lives
beside the history as well.

**Switching it off destroys data, and the screen says so first.** The server refuses to
save the switch off while kept shipments or trips are in the database; the screen asks,
names the counts, and on confirmation deletes the kept shipments and trips before saving
the switch. The address book, the articles library and the adviser's reports stay. A
switch alone never deletes anything, and nothing is deleted at start-up, ever: a database
that holds kept shipments while the setting says off — an installation that dropped the
variable from its environment after upgrading, say — gets the setting switched back on at
start-up and a line in the log, never a hidden table. What is kept per shipment,
and what is not, is in [Privacy](privacy.md#the-shipment-history).

## Branding

An administrator gives the installation its own face under **Settings → Administration →
Branding**: a name, a logo, and a picture per transport mode for the tiles on the first
screen. The name is a setting like the others; the pictures are files.

| Variable | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `BRAND_NAME` | The name in the header, on the sign-in page and in the browser tab | empty, meaning EMCargo |

The pictures live in `DATA_DIR/branding`, one file per asset, named by what it is and
by what it *is* rather than what it was called: `logo.png`, `logo.jpg` or `logo.webp`,
and `modality-road.png` and so on for `road`, `rail`, `sea`, `inland`, `air` and
`multimodal`. PNG, JPEG and WebP are accepted, recognised by their bytes; SVG is not,
because an SVG can carry script and an image route that serves one is a page that runs
it. A logo may be 1 MB, a tile 3 MB. Operators can also place these files in the
branding folder and set `BRAND_NAME`. The uploaded logo travels in outgoing mail,
and since v1.178.0 the name and the logo are printed in the header and the foot of every
document EMCargo draws itself; the official forms are filled in, not rebranded.
## Essentials

| Variable | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_SECRET_KEY` | Signs login sessions. Leave it empty and EMCargo generates one on first start and keeps it in `DATA_DIR/secret_key`. | generated |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | Username of the first admin, created on first startup | — |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | Email of the first admin | — |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password of the first admin. **Set this.** | — |
| `TZ` | Time zone used for dates on documents | `Europe/Amsterdam` |

All three `ADMIN_*` variables must be present together, or no account is created. There
is no public sign-up page.

## The signing key looks after itself

`APP_SECRET_KEY` signs the token that says you are logged in. Its default, `change-me`,
is published in this repository — so an installation that never set it would run on a key
anyone can look up, and anyone holding that key can write themselves a valid admin token.
There is no login to bypass at that point; it is already bypassed.

You do not have to do anything about that. On the first start EMCargo generates a key,
stores it as `secret_key` in `DATA_DIR` (readable only by the owner) and uses it from then
on. It survives restarts and container recreation because it lives on the mounted volume.

Set `APP_SECRET_KEY` yourself only if you want to manage the key — to share it across
several instances, for example, or to keep it in your own secret store. A value you set
always wins, as long as it is not a published one and is at least 32 characters:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"
```

**Changing the key logs everyone out.** Existing tokens were signed with the old key and
stop validating. Nothing else is lost — no shipment data hangs on it.

Changing a user's password also invalidates every session belonging to that user. Login
tokens contain a one-way fingerprint of the password hash that was current when the token
was issued. After a password change that fingerprint no longer matches and the user must
log in again on every device.

> **This used to be a refusal, and that was a mistake.** From v1.25.0 to v1.29.2
> EMCargo stopped at startup on a published or empty key. The reasoning was sound —
> nobody reads a warning in a log — but the defaults it shipped with (`change-me` and
> `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*`) and the Unraid template, which leaves the key blank, meant
> that every installation which had not filled both in by itself simply died on startup,
> in a container that exited too fast to read the message. Nothing was made safer; the app
> was just gone. Since v1.29.3 it makes a key instead. See the changelog for v1.29.3.

## What is reported but does not stop anything

Two settings are worth a line in the log without being worth a dead application:

| Reported | Why | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*` | The wildcard is answered without credentials since v1.190.0, so a call from another website cannot carry the login cookie — but the setting still says more than it should | Name the address you reach EMCargo on |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` set to one that appears in this project's documentation | It is not a password if it is printed in a README | Pick your own, and change it after first login |

### While developing

A fixed, known key is convenient there, so these reports only appear in production. Set
`APP_ENV` to `development`, `dev`, `local`, `test` or `testing` and they are skipped.
Anything else — including an empty value or a typo — counts as production, so a misspelled
`APP_ENV` cannot quietly switch them off. The key itself is still made safe in every
environment: development is a reason not to nag, not a reason to sign tokens with a
published string.

## Storage

| Variable | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `DATA_DIR` | Folder for the database, templates and logs | `/data` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLite database location | the existing SQLite file in `/data` (override with `DATABASE_URL` only for a deliberate database migration) |
| `PUID` / `PGID` | User and group that should own `/data` | `1000` / `1000` |

Keep `/data` on a persistent volume. It holds your users, the equipment you imported and
the catalogue sync status. Documents are never stored there.

## Reference data

| Variable | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `CATALOG_AUTO_SYNC` | Refresh material and profile catalogues from public sources at startup | `true` |
| `CATALOG_SYNC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | HTTP timeout per source | `20` |

Set `CATALOG_AUTO_SYNC=false` for a faster or fully offline startup. The data bundled in
the image is used instead, and weight calculations are unaffected. The same switch sits on
the settings screen; because it is only read while the application starts, a change there
takes effect on the next restart.

## Update check

| Variable | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `UPDATE_CHECK_ENABLED` | Ask GitHub whether a newer release exists, when an administrator is signed in | `true` |
| `UPDATE_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | HTTP timeout for that one request | `8` |
| `INSTALL_METHOD` | How this installation runs: `docker` (the image), `native` (the systemd service of `deploy/native`) or `kubernetes` (`deploy/kubernetes`). Decides only what the settings screen says about updating: the routes that are not Docker have no in-app updater and the screen names theirs instead | `docker` |
| `UPDATE_APPLY_PULL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | How long the image pull may take before the update is abandoned | `600` |

The check only tells the administrator there is something to pull. Off means EMCargo
never contacts GitHub for release checks; the switch also sits under **Settings →
Updates** and is read per request, so flipping it needs no restart.

### Updating from inside the application

In-app updates are enabled by default for administrators. The retired
`UPDATE_APPLY_ENABLED` variable is ignored, even when an older template sets it
to `false`. A supported Docker installation still needs access to the Docker API.
Mount its socket in the compose file (or as a path mapping on Unraid):

```yaml
volumes:
  - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

The settings screen's **Updates** section offers an **Update and restart** button
whenever a newer release exists. The application runs as uid 1000 while the socket
belongs to root (Unraid) or the docker group (most distributions); the container's
start script joins the app user to the socket's own group id before dropping
privileges, so no permission fiddling is needed on the host — this works since
v1.135.0, and when something else still blocks the capability, the Updating section
now names the exact reason instead of staying silent. Pressing it pulls `ghcr.io/jeffreymooiweer/emcargo` at the
release's own tag (never `latest`, never a caller-supplied name), then hands the swap to
a short-lived helper container started from that new image: it stops the application,
renames it aside, recreates it with the identical configuration on the new image, starts
it, and only then removes the old one. If the new container will not start, the old one
is put back and the failure is reported on the settings screen — a failed update leaves
a working installation.

> [!WARNING]
> Mounting the Docker socket into a container gives that container administrator rights
> over the whole host — that is what makes the swap possible at all. It is a deliberate
> operator decision, off by default; without it, EMCargo only ever *reports* updates
> and the manual `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` (or Unraid's update
> button, or Watchtower) remains the way.

## Address lookup

| Variable | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `GEO_ADDRESS_API_URL` | A Photon-compatible geocoder for address autocomplete | `https://photon.komoot.io/api` |
| `GEO_ADDRESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | HTTP timeout | `8` |

Point this at your own Photon instance if you would rather not call an external service.
Without it, address autocomplete simply stops offering suggestions — typing addresses by
hand always works, and airport, port and station search runs entirely offline.

This is the only request EMCargo makes to the outside world while somebody is using it,
so the settings screen carries a switch that stops it being made at all. Turning it off is
not the same as pointing it at an unreachable address: no request leaves the server.

## Mail server

EMCargo sends nothing until an administrator says where to send it. **Settings →
Administration → Mail server** asks for the server, the port, how the connection is
encrypted, the sign-in if the server wants one, and the sender address.

| Variable | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SMTP_HOST` | The mail server. Empty means no mail server | empty |
| `SMTP_PORT` | Port | `587` |
| `SMTP_SECURITY` | `starttls` (port 587), `ssl` (implicit TLS, port 465) or `none` | `starttls` |
| `SMTP_USERNAME` | Sign-in, if the server asks for one | empty |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | The password for that sign-in | empty |
| `SMTP_FROM` | The sender address. Most relays refuse a sender they do not own | empty |
| `SMTP_FROM_NAME` | The name shown beside the sender address | empty |
| `SMTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | How long to wait on the server | `15` |

A host **and** a sender in the environment switch sending on; the screen can then change
anything about it without a restart, and what is saved there takes precedence.

**The password.** It is stored on the server and never sent back to a browser: the screen
shows an empty password field and, when one is stored, says so. Leaving that field empty
when saving keeps the stored password — so the port can be corrected without retyping it.
Replacing it means typing a new one.

**Test message.** The button beside the settings sends a short message to the address you
give it, or to your own account when you leave it empty. It uses the settings **as saved**,
not the ones on screen, so save first — a test that passes on unsaved values and fails on
the saved ones would be worse than no test. Whatever the mail server answers is shown
unchanged: a refused password, an unreachable host and a rejected sender are different
problems with different fixes.

**The address of this installation.** The links in outgoing mail need to say where
EMCargo lives. Left empty, the address is read from the request, including the
`X-Forwarded-*` headers when `TRUSTED_PROXY_HEADERS` is on — right whenever the browser
reaches EMCargo directly or through a proxy that passes its own host on. Fill it in
(`https://emcargo.example.com`) when it does not, or the mail carries a link to an
internal container name.

**Forgotten passwords.** With a mail server configured, the sign-in screen offers "Forgot
your password?". The link checks itself before it draws the form, so a link that has already
been used says so straight away instead of after somebody has typed a new password twice.
Setting the password signs the person in: holding the link proved the mailbox and the
password was chosen on that very screen. A second factor is not waived by that — the same
second step follows as at any sign-in. The answer is the same whatever is typed — whether the account exists,
is active, has an address, or the relay accepted the message is never revealed, because a
form that tells them apart is a way to find out who has an account here. What went wrong
is written to the log instead. The link works once, expires after an hour, and using it
ends every session that was signed in with the old password. Only a hash of the token is
stored, so a leaked database hands out no working links.

**Inviting a new colleague.** With a mail server, creating a user offers "Send an
invitation": no password is typed by the administrator at all. The new user gets a link to
choose their own, valid for seven days, and until they use it the account carries a random
hash nobody can sign in with. Whether the invitation actually went out is reported back —
an administrator who believes a message was sent that never was is worse off than one who
knows to pass the link on by hand.

**What uses it.** The test message, the forgotten-password link, the invitation, and the export step: with a mail server configured, the
documents step offers to mail the same archive the download button produces — to the
carrier, the consignee, or several addresses at once. The archive is deleted the moment the
message is out; EMCargo keeps no copy of a consignment's papers. One message may carry
15 MB of attachments; beyond that the size and the limit are named rather than left to the
relay to refuse.

Without a mail server the export step shows no mail button at all: a button that can only
fail is not a feature.

## Two-factor verification

**Settings → Administration → Two-factor verification** decides who needs a second step:
voluntary (the default), required for administrators, or required for everyone. Nobody is
locked out when it is switched on — someone without a second factor signs in as before and
is taken to the panel that sets one up. Since v1.190.0 that is the only thing the account
can do until the factor is confirmed: every other call is refused by the server with
`auth.two_factor_required`, not only discouraged by the screen.

Each person picks their own method under **Settings → My details**:

- **An authenticator app.** The usual six digits, scanned from a QR code this server draws
  itself — a QR fetched from an image service would send the shared secret to somebody
  else's server. Works offline and does not depend on the mail server.
- **A code by e-mail.** Nothing to install, and it needs a mail server. It is the weaker of
  the two: whoever can read the mailbox can sign in.

**Switching it off.** Turning the second factor off asks for a working code, so a borrowed
session cannot strip the protection it is facing. With the mail method a code only exists
once one has been sent, so the panel has a button that mails one; a recovery code works
there too.

**Losing the second factor.** Switching it on hands out eight recovery codes, shown once.
Each works one time and is accepted wherever a code is asked for, so a phone in a canal
does not mean a different form. If those are gone too, any administrator can clear the
second factor from the users page — which is one more reason for an installation to have
more than one administrator.

**What the codes are worth.** Recovery and mailed codes are stored as hashes; a mailed code
expires in five minutes and dies after five wrong guesses; an authenticator code is accepted
one 30-second step either side of now, which is what an unsynced phone looks like.

## QR code with UN cards on documents

**Settings → Administration → QR code with UN cards on documents** prints a QR code on
every transport document EMCargo renders. Scanning it opens a page listing the UN
numbers on that document and, per number, the UN card this installation holds for it.

That page is the only one in EMCargo that does not ask for a sign-in. That is the
point: the driver at the roadside, the warehouse taking the pallet in and the responder
who arrived because something went wrong have no account here, and a code that asks them
to log in is a code that does nothing.

It is off until you turn it on, and it needs two things, not one:

1. the switch, and
2. **Address of this installation** filled in, the same field the mail links use.

Without the address no code is printed at all. The address cannot be taken from the
request the way a mail link's can — nobody is making a request when the driver scans the
sheet three days later — and a code on paper that leads nowhere is worse than no code,
because whoever is holding the paper cannot tell that from a code that failed to scan.
The screen says so beside the switch rather than letting you find out on a printout.

**What the code carries** is the UN numbers and the regime, and nothing else: no
consignor, no consignee, no quantity, no reference, no shipment identifier. The document
it is printed on already carries those same UN numbers in plain text and larger. See
[Privacy](privacy.md#what-a-stranger-can-reach) for the whole of what a stranger can
reach.

**What the page answers** is the number and whether a card exists — a missing card is
reported missing rather than quietly left out of the list, and a card is never
substituted from another regime, because ADR and IMDG print different obligations. It
serves the card set an administrator imported under **Settings → UN Cards**; with no set
imported every number reads *no card*.

**What holds it down.** At most thirty UN numbers per link, thirty requests a minute per
caller, and files served only from the imported card store. With the switch off the route
answers `404` rather than `403`: an installation that has not opened this door does not
owe a stranger the information that the door exists.

Nothing here expires. The link addresses a UN number rather than a consignment, so a code
scanned in a year answers what it answered on the day it was printed.

## Application and security

| Variable | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_NAME` | Name in the API title and in `GET /api/health`. **Not** the name on screen — the interface takes that from its own language files. | `EMCargo` |
| `APP_ENV` | `production` or `development` | `production` |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | How long a login stays valid | `480` (8 hours) |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | Override the login-cookie `Secure` flag. Empty means automatic: enabled for HTTPS or trusted `X-Forwarded-Proto=https`. | automatic |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Allowed origins for a separate website using the API. Empty keeps the bundled same-origin interface working. Named origins permit credentials; any list containing `*` permits only anonymous cross-origin reads | empty |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_HEADERS` | Honour `X-Forwarded-*` headers; enable only when controlled reverse proxies are the only route to the backend | `false` |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` | How many reverse proxies stand in front. Decides which `X-Forwarded-For` entry a rate limit counts against | `1` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` | `INFO` |

Upload limits are not configurable. An imported file is capped at 10 MB, 20,000 rows and
100 columns, and an `.xlsx` at 50 MB uncompressed — those are safety limits against a
malformed or hostile file, not a preference, and they live in
`backend/app/services/spreadsheet_io.py`.

> `MAX_PASTE_BYTES` was listed here until v1.47.0 and was read by nothing at all. The
> upload cap has always come from the constant above. A documented setting that does
> nothing is worse than an undocumented one: it invites somebody to tune it and conclude
> the app ignores them.

If you put EMCargo behind a reverse proxy, explicitly set `TRUSTED_PROXY_HEADERS=true`
and prevent direct access to the backend port. The bundled interface still needs no
CORS setting; list an origin only for a separate interface that calls this API.
The login cookie is then
marked `Secure` when the proxy sends `X-Forwarded-Proto=https`. Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true`
when you want to force that behaviour, or `false` only for a deliberate HTTP-only setup.

**Rate limits.** Signing in, resetting a password and the second factor have been
limited since long before; since v1.164.0 so are the endpoints that cost something:
rendering a document (60 a minute), the bundle (10), mailing the bundle (5), UN cards
(10), reading a carrier confirmation (20), a turn of the assistant (120), asking for its
model to be downloaded (3), and address autocomplete (60). None of them is configurable,
and none is set where somebody doing the work would meet it — they exist so a script
cannot spend the host's CPU, somebody else's free geocoder, or the sending domain's
reputation. The full list lives in `backend/app/core/ratelimit.py`, with what each one is
for.

**And set `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` to the number of proxies you actually have.** It decides
which entry of `X-Forwarded-For` the sign-in rate limit is counted against, and the
default of `1` is right for one nginx, Caddy or Traefik in front. Put a CDN in front of
that and it is `2`.

The number matters in both directions. Too low counts against a proxy instead of the
client, so people share a budget. Too high can read a caller-supplied entry to the left
of the controlled proxy chain; if the header is shorter than the configured count,
EMCargo falls back to the peer address. A proxy *appends* what it saw, so the rightmost
entries are the trustworthy ones and each controlled proxy accounts for one of them.

**Upgrading to 2.1.0.** An existing explicit environment value is respected. When no
value was set, forwarded-header trust now becomes `false` and CORS becomes empty.
Operators using a reverse proxy must explicitly enable trust and set the correct proxy
count; otherwise callers share the proxy's rate-limit budget. Set `PUBLIC_URL` to the
external HTTPS address for mail and document links, and `COOKIE_SECURE=true` for an
HTTPS-only deployment. Native and Kubernetes examples already opt into proxy trust
because their documented deployment puts a controlled proxy in front.

Recovery-code renewal now requires a current authenticator, email or recovery code.
The bundled settings screen asks for it. Custom clients calling
`POST /api/auth/two-factor/recovery-codes` must send `{"code":"…"}`; requests without
proof no longer create replacement codes. Confirmation, renewal and disabling each
allow ten code-verification attempts per minute. This stops a stolen session from
minting a new second factor or guessing codes without the login limit.

User roles are restricted to `admin` and `user`. EMCargo prevents an administrator from
disabling or demoting their own account and refuses to remove the last active administrator.
This prevents an installation from locking itself out through the user-management screen.

## Checking your setup

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "app": "EMCargo",
  "version": "1.45.0",
  "regulatory": {
    "manifest_id": "1dbeb6c1ca91cfd5",
    "editions": {
      "adr": "2025",
      "imdg": "Amendment 42-24 (2024 Edition)",
      "ems": "MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.3",
      "iata": "67e editie (2026)"
    },
    "expired": ["imdg_un_cards"]
  }
}
```

`regulatory` names the editions this installation actually computes with, so a bug report
can say so without guessing. `GET /api/regulatory` gives the full version, including the
source and validity period per rule set — see [Data sources](data-sources.md#which-edition-is-running).
