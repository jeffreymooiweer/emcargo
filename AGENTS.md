## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

EMCargo is a single product with two dev processes: a Python 3.12 FastAPI backend
(`backend/`, port 8080) and a React/Vite/TypeScript frontend (`frontend/`, Vite dev
server on port 5173 that proxies `/api` → `http://localhost:8080`). Data is stored in
file-based SQLite; there is no separate database service. Standard commands live in
`docs/development.md`, `backend/requirements.txt`, and `frontend/package.json`.

Python dependencies are installed into a virtualenv at `/workspace/.venv` (the startup
update script creates it and installs `backend/requirements.txt`; frontend deps via
`npm install`). Use `/workspace/.venv/bin/python` / `/workspace/.venv/bin/uvicorn` /
`/workspace/.venv/bin/pytest` when running the backend.

Non-obvious gotchas for running/testing:

- **Env vars are NOT auto-loaded from the repo `.env` when running uvicorn from `backend/`.**
  Pydantic settings use `env_file=".env"` resolved relative to the current working
  directory, and there is no `backend/.env`. Pass config explicitly when running dev.
- **`DATA_DIR`/`DATABASE_URL` default to `/data` (not writable in this environment).**
  For local dev, point them at the repo, e.g. `DATA_DIR=/workspace/data` and
  `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////workspace/data/emcargo.db`. Create `data/` if missing;
  the backend seeds catalogs on startup.
- **Admin bootstrap:** there is no public registration. The first admin is created on
  startup only if `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` are set. Log in
  with those credentials.
- **`CATALOG_AUTO_SYNC` defaults to `true`** and fetches reference catalogs from external
  URLs at every startup (with per-source HTTP timeouts). Set `CATALOG_AUTO_SYNC=false`
  for faster/offline dev startup — it falls back to the bundled seeds in `backend/seed/`
  and does not affect weight calculations.
- **Material recognition input format (important for manual testing):** the wizard's
  Excel/text import expects one line per row as `description | quantity | unit`
  (pipe- or tab-separated), with dimensions embedded in the description, e.g.
  `Stalen hoekprofiel 80x80x8x6000 | 8 | stuks`. Free-text descriptions without
  dimensions yield `status=error` and 0 kg. The steel regression set totals ~7534 kg.
- **Equipment library starts empty.** Seed tests use generic `DEMO-*` items; no
  operational equipment JSON ships with the repo.
- **`APP_SECRET_KEY=dev-secret` is not actually used.** It is on the published-secrets
  list, so the app replaces it with a generated key, stored in `DATA_DIR/secret_key` and
  reused from then on. That happens in every environment — `APP_ENV=development` only
  silences the CORS and admin-password warnings, it does not license signing tokens with
  a published string. Delete `DATA_DIR/secret_key` and you are logged out once.
- **Four interface languages.** Any new string goes into `frontend/src/i18n/nl.json`,
  `en.json`, `de.json` *and* `fr.json`, and any new `{nl, en}` block in the config or
  seed data needs a `de` and an `fr`. `backend/tests/test_languages.py` reads
  `SUPPORTED` and fails otherwise — it names no language, so a fifth is one line.
- **An error the user reads goes through `app/core/messages.py`.** It carries a code the
  interface translates, with an English fallback. A Dutch sentence in a `raise` fails
  `test_error_messages.py`.
- **Comments and docstrings are in English.** Everything a user reads is translated;
  everything a developer reads is English, across `backend/`, `frontend/`, `scripts/`
  and the workflows. Test docstrings stay long and explain *why* the test exists, with
  the real defect that provoked it — that is the project's institutional memory, and it
  is written in English since v1.46.0.

Example dev run (from repo root):

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////workspace/data/emcargo.db DATA_DIR=/workspace/data \
  APP_ENV=development APP_SECRET_KEY=dev-secret \
  ADMIN_USERNAME=admin ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.local \
  ADMIN_PASSWORD=emcargo123 CATALOG_AUTO_SYNC=false \
  /workspace/.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080

# Frontend (separate shell)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

- **Tests:** `cd backend && DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////workspace/data/emcargo_test.db DATA_DIR=/workspace/data /workspace/.venv/bin/python -m pytest`
- **Frontend tests:** `cd frontend && npm test` (Vitest + Testing Library).
- **Typecheck/build (no ESLint configured):** `cd frontend && npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build`).
