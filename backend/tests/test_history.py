"""The shipment history: kept only where the switch is on, and never orphaned.

What is pinned here, in the order it matters:

1. **With the switch off the addresses do not exist.** Not 401, not 403 — 404,
   like every other route the installation does not have. The open
   application ignores the switch altogether.
2. **The switch is the administrator's** — a setting on the screen, read on
   every request — and off never hides data: switching it off with kept
   shipments in the table is refused until they are deleted, on the screen,
   after a confirmation that names the counts; and a database that holds
   shipments while the setting says off gets the setting switched back on
   at start-up.
3. **The kept record is the structured export, built by the server** from
   the same parts the download uses, so the two cannot disagree — and the
   index columns a list filters on come out of it.
4. **The documents again come from the kept bundle**, through the same code
   path as the export step's download.
5. **The schema runner** stamps a fresh database and migrates an old one, and
   running it twice does nothing the second time.
