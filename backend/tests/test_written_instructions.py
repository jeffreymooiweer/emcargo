"""The instructions in writing, and what the application may claim about them.

ADR and ADN 5.4.3.4 print the instructions rather than describe them: the
document a crew carries has to correspond in form and content to a model of
four pages that the book sets out. So this is the one document EMCargo does
not compose — it takes the model out of the edition in the document store and
hands that over. The rules these tests hold to:

* a model is offered per regime *and* per language, and a language the store
  cannot produce says so instead of being filled in from another language;
* the page range a model is cut at was measured from the edition itself, not
  guessed, and the register carries it;
* the endpoint refuses honestly, naming the document that is missing.
