"""Four consignments, end to end, through the API a wizard actually calls.

The plan for this application named a closing step: walk four archetypes —
packaged goods by road, a road tank, a dry cargo vessel, a tank vessel — from
the goods to the last download, and see what comes out. Doing that by hand once
proves the day it was done. Doing it here proves it on every commit, and that
is the difference between a verification and an anecdote.

Each archetype asserts three things:

* **the compliance answer** carries the checks that mode is entitled to, and
  not the ones it is not — a tank vessel must not be answered with the dry
  cargo vessel's chapter 7.1, and a packages consignment must not be asked
  about a tank;
* **the documents** the wizard would offer are the documents that consignment
  needs, and each one that EMCargo generates actually renders;
* **what the application cannot say** is said. Every archetype ends on the
  finding that names its own limit, because an answer with a silent hole in it
  is the failure this whole application is built against.
