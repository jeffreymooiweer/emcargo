"""Every step once, and emulation only when something is published.

There were two workflows in this repository both called ``CI`` and both firing
on the same push: ``ci.yml`` and ``dockerhub.yml``. They largely did the same
thing. ``pytest`` ran twice, ``npm ci`` ran twice, and there were five checks
under a pull request of which two were copies of two others. On a release with
three commits on the branch that was fifteen jobs before anything was merged.

The second cost was the Docker build. It always asked for ``linux/arm64``, on a
pull request too, where the result was then thrown away because nothing is
pushed. arm64 runs on an amd64 runner under QEMU, and that emulation was the
lion's share of the runtime.

That kind of duplicated work creeps back in unnoticed — a second workflow is
quickly added and nobody counts the checks. Hence these tests. They read the
YAML as text; that is deliberately crude, because what is guarded here is not
the exact wording but the shape: one CI workflow, narrowly scoped publishing
workflows, no duplicates, and no emulation without publication.
