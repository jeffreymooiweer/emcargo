"""Who a rate limit counts against, behind a proxy and in front of one.

The bug this covers was invisible in every test and in every direct-to-container
deployment: `slowapi`'s own key function reads `request.client.host`, which
behind a reverse proxy is the proxy, so all callers shared one bucket. Fifteen
colleagues behind one nginx shared ten sign-in attempts a minute.

The half-fix is worse than the bug and is what most of these tests are about. A
proxy *appends* to `X-Forwarded-For`, so a caller can put anything they like to
the left of what the proxy saw. Keying on the left of that list hands every
caller a fresh bucket per request, which is a rate limiter that does not limit.
