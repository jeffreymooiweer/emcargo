"""The register of source documents, and what it promises.

``backend/seed/dg/sources.json`` is the durable half of the regulatory
database: the documents live in a store outside the repository, and this file
is what proves which exact files the facts were read from. A register nobody
checks decays into a wish list, so these tests pin the properties the
architecture depends on.

What is deliberately *not* tested here is the store itself — CI runners have no
``/data`` and an empty store is a legitimate state. The one bridge test runs
only where documents are actually present.
