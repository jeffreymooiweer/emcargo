"""Tests for the IMDG column 16b segregation provisions.

The class segregation table of 7.2.4 works on class. Column 16b adds provisions
per *substance* — "stow separated from acids" — which the app now knows for 840
UN numbers. The meaning of each SG code is read from the cards themselves rather
than typed from memory, because a wrong segregation rule is a safety-relevant
error, not a cosmetic one.

These tests pin the parsed rules and the behaviour that follows from them.
