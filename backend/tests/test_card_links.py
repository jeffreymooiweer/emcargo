"""The one public route in the application, and what keeps it narrow.

Everything else here is behind a sign-in. This is not, because the people a QR
code on a transport document is for — the driver at the roadside, the warehouse
taking the pallet in, the responder who arrived because something went wrong —
have no account here, and a code that asks them to log in is a code that does
nothing.

A public route earns a test per promise, so each of these pins one:

* it is **closed until an administrator opens it**, and closed means invisible;
* it answers about **UN numbers only** — there is no consignment to look up, so
  there is nothing about a shipment that could leak through it;
* it **never substitutes a card from another modality**, because the regimes
  print different obligations and a card answering for the wrong one is worse
  than no card;
* it **reports what is missing** rather than handing back a shorter list;
* it is **bounded**: a capped number of UN numbers, and a rate limit.

And the printing half: a code is only put on paper when it will still work when
the paper is read, which needs both the switch and an address.
