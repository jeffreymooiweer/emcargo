"""Departments: who sees whose kept shipments.

The rule is in ``services/departments.py`` and these tests pin it from the
outside: an administrator sees everything and may filter; anybody else sees
their own department's shipments, and a user without a department sees the
unassigned ones — so an organisation that never makes a department keeps
today's behaviour, everybody seeing everything. A shipment another
department kept is, for the viewer, not there: 404, not 403.
