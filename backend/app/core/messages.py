"""Errors the user reads, in a form the interface can translate.

Until v1.48.0 every message the API sent back was a Dutch sentence written
straight into the ``raise``. A German user who uploaded an empty file was told so
in Dutch; so was a French one who asked for a UN number the ADR table does not
hold. The interface speaks four languages and its errors spoke one, which is the
kind of gap nobody reports because it only shows up once something has already
gone wrong.

The backend does not translate. It cannot: the message may be raised deep in a
service that has no idea who is asking, and the language belongs to the screen,
not to the server. What it sends instead is a **code**, the parameters that go
in the sentence, and an English text as a fallback:

    {"code": "import.empty_file", "message": "Empty file", "params": {}}

The interface looks the code up in its own language files and falls back to
``message`` when it does not know it — so an error is always readable, even one
added by a newer backend than the frontend in front of it.

Codes are dotted and stable. Renaming one is a breaking change for the
translations, and ``test_error_messages.py`` holds every code here to a key in
all four language files.
