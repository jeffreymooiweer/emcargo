"""Departments: who sees whose kept shipments.

The rule, in one place so the routes cannot each keep their own version:

- An **administrator** sees every kept shipment, and may narrow the list to
  one department or to the shipments nobody's department claims.
- Anybody else sees the shipments of **their own department** — and a user
  without a department sees the shipments without one. An organisation that
  never makes a department therefore keeps today's behaviour, everybody
  seeing everything, without anyone having to set anything.

A shipment's department is the keeper's department at the moment it was
kept, copied onto the row. Somebody moving departments does not take last
year's shipments along, and a department removed leaves its shipments and
its people without one rather than deleting either.
