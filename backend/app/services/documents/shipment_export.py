"""The whole shipment as structured data, versioned, for something else to read.

Every other exporter in this package produces paper. This one produces the
shipment itself: what was filled in, what was carried, and — the part that
makes it worth more than a form dump — **what EMCargo worked out**. A
receiving system that gets only the typed fields has to re-derive the
regulatory answer, and re-derivation is where two systems start to disagree.

Why now, and why JSON rather than a standard. The EU eFTI Regulation applies in
full from 9 July 2027, from when authorities must accept freight information
electronically through certified platforms, and the eFTI data set is built on
the UN/CEFACT Multi-Modal Transport reference data model. EMCargo is not
going to become a certified platform — that is a certification regime for
platform providers, and this application is a documentation tool. What it can
be is trivially connectable to one. That starts with a shipment being able to
leave as structured data at all, which is what this is.

So the format is EMCargo's own and says so. Mapping it onto MMT-RDM is a
separate exercise against the published model, and inventing half a mapping
here would be worse than none: a field named as though it were the standard's,
carrying something subtly else, is exactly the failure that makes an integration
silently wrong. ``docs/shipment-export.md`` records what is known about the
correspondence and what still has to be read.

Three rules the format follows.

**Versioned, and the version means something.** ``format_version`` changes when
a reader would break. A field added is not a break; a field renamed, removed or
given a different meaning is. A reader that checks the major version and ignores
keys it does not know will keep working.

**Nothing is invented.** A field the user left empty is absent, not an empty
string, and a check that did not run is absent rather than reported as passing.
The compliance answer travels exactly as the panel received it, with the
editions it was computed against — which the answer already names — so a
shipment exported today can be told apart from the same shipment re-derived
under a later edition.

**It carries no user and no installation.** The export describes a consignment,
not who typed it. That keeps it the same file whoever produces it, and keeps
``docs/privacy.md``'s promise that a finished job leaves nothing behind.
