"""The runtime store of generated UN cards: download, verify, swap, serve.

The cards themselves — thousands of PDFs — are deliberately not part of the
Docker image or the repository. The **Generate UN cards** workflow publishes
the complete current set as a GitHub Release asset
(``cargopilot-un-cards.zip``), and an administrator imports it here: into
``<data-dir>/un-cards/``, the same persistent volume the rest of the
application's data lives on, so the set survives restarts and updates.

Nothing here trusts the archive. Member names must match the exact shapes
the generator produces (which kills path traversal outright), sizes are
capped before extraction, every card is hashed against the manifest it
arrived with, and the new set replaces the old one only after the whole of
it has been verified — a failed import leaves the working set untouched.
Downloads go only to the release feed of the pinned repository; no caller
can point the server at another URL.
