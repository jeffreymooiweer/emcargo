"""The shipment history: keeping, listing and letting go.

Everything else in EMCargo forgets a shipment the moment its papers are
downloaded. This module is the one place that remembers, and it does so only
while an administrator of the organisation application has *Keep shipments*
switched on — the routes that call it answer 404 otherwise, and
:func:`adopt_kept_data` at start-up makes sure a database cannot hold
shipments the running application refuses to acknowledge.

**Switching the history off destroys data, and says so first.** The settings
route refuses to switch it off while shipments or trips are in the table; the
administrator has them deleted first, on the screen, after a confirmation
that names the counts. Nothing is deleted by a switch alone; a table kept
while the interface claims it does not exist would be the one outcome worse
than either choice.
