"""Which edition of which regulations sits in this installation.

EMCargo computes with five rule sets, each with its own revision rhythm: ADR
every two years, the IMDG Code every two years with a transitional year, the
IATA DGR *every* year. Until now that provenance was spread over the seeds, the
compliance configuration and the documentation, and there was no way to see from
the outside what a running installation actually uses.

That is not merely bookkeeping. The IATA DGR 67th edition applies up to and
including 31 December 2026; on 1 January 2027 this app computes with an expired
edition and there is nothing that says so. The manifest therefore carries a
validity period per rule set, and `expired_rule_sets()` turns that into a
statement.

The checksum is there for the opposite case: a seed that changed quietly. Two
installations reporting the same manifest id compute with the same data.
