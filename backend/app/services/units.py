"""Units, and converting between them with the help of density.

Until now the unit of a line was a free text field with "stuks" as the default.
Anyone entering 1200 litres of diesel got 1200 *pieces* of diesel, and had to
add the weight themselves. That is not so much a missing feature as a missing
concept: a quantity without a unit means nothing, and with a unit it means
exactly one thing.

The model is small on purpose. Every unit has a **dimension** — mass, volume,
length or count — and a factor to the base unit of that dimension (kilogram or
cubic metre). Between mass and volume lies exactly one bridge: the density of
the commodity. That makes every conversion this application needs a
multiplication, and means no table of substance-specific exceptions is required
anywhere.

Where this can go wrong, and why there is a ``DensityBasis`` here: 20 m³ of
gravel times the density of gravel is right, 20 m³ of steel times the density of
steel is right, and 20 m³ of *stacked* timber is neither — there is air in
between. The goods database carries no field saying what kind of density a
figure is; ``docs/data-sources.md`` claimed for years that it did. So that basis
is *derived* here from the category and reported as derived, not as established.

# --- The form it travels in ------------------------------------------------
#
# The density of oak is 720 kg/m³ and that of steel 7850. Those are the
# densities of the material itself. A cubic metre of stacked planks, a cubic
# metre of loose firewood and a cubic metre of solid beam are three different
# weights of the same timber, and the difference is air.
#
# v1.35.0 solved that with a single hidden factor of 0.65 for all timber. That
# was an average describing nobody's load. Instead the user now picks the form,
# and the form carries the factor. The same goes for steel (plate versus scrap),
# plastic (granulate versus regrind) and paper (bales versus loose).
#
# **Where this choice does not apply.** For gravel, grain and ore the stored
# figure is already a bulk density: that substance is never carried other than
# in bulk and the database describes it in that state. Laying another bulk
# factor over it counts the air twice. The same holds for liquids and for the
# practical averages per pallet. The form is therefore only offered where the
# stored figure describes the substance itself — see ``form_applies``.
#
# The factors are practical values and not standards. They are here because
# ``seed_catalogs`` only fills the goods table when it is empty: new seed data
# never reaches an existing installation.
