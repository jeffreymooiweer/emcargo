"""The document store, seen from the running application.

``scripts/regulations_store.py`` fills a directory with the editions the seeds
were read from; this is the half of that story the server needs. It answers two
questions: where a registered document is on this installation, and how to hand
a driver or a boatmaster the one regulatory document the application may not
paraphrase — the instructions in writing.

ADR 5.4.3.4 and ADN 5.4.3.4 print the instructions rather than describe them:
they must "correspond in form and content" to a model of four pages that the
book itself sets out. A document that has to correspond in *form* cannot be
rebuilt from a database, so what the application offers is the model itself,
taken out of the edition in the store, page range measured with
``scripts/find_instructions_pages.py`` and written into the register beside the
document it is cut from.

The instructions are not the only such model. ADN 8.6.3 prints the checklist
for loading and unloading a tank vessel the same way, and 8.6.4 the one for
degassing. So a model is addressed by its **provision** as well as by regime
and language, and everything below takes all three. Nothing here interprets a
model or fills one in: the application may hand over the form, and the form is
what the book prints.

Nothing here downloads anything. A model the store cannot produce is reported
as missing, with the document that would produce it named, because a carrier
who thinks they have the instructions and has not is worse off than one who
knows they still have to fetch them.
