"""Writing and reading the audit log.

``record`` is called from the routes and never raises: an audit line that
cannot be written is logged as an error and the action it describes goes
through regardless, because refusing to keep a shipment over a full disk
in the audit table would be the wrong way round. ``prune`` applies the
retention an administrator set. ``page`` and ``rows`` read it back for the
administrator's screen and its export.

What goes in is fixed here in one place — the action codes with a word on
what their summary may say — so a new route cannot quietly start writing
something the privacy page did not promise.
