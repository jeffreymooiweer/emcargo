"""A shipment the organisation chose to keep.

Only the organisation application with *Keep shipments* switched on by an
administrator ever writes a row here; every other installation has this
table empty. Switching it off is refused while rows are here, and the
start-up check in ``services/history.py`` switches it back on for a database
that holds rows anyway, so a kept shipment is never silently orphaned.

Three documents per row, each for a different reader:

- ``snapshot_json`` is the wizard's own state, opaque to the server. It is
  what "open in the wizard" restores, and only the interface reads it.
- ``bundle_json`` is the document bundle request as the export step sent
  it. It is what "the documents again" re-renders — the same code path as
  the download button, so what comes back is what went out.
- ``export_json`` is the structured shipment export of v1.161.0: the
  documented, versioned record with the derived findings and the editions
  they were computed against. It is what a later reader — a report, a
  groupage picked from the history, an eFTI connector — reads.

The columns beside them are the index: what a list filters and sorts on
without opening a document. They are copied out of the export at save time,
because a page that filters wants real columns.
