/**
 * The frame around a shipment.
 *
 * Until this release the wizard's furniture was four strips stacked on top of
 * each other — a modality chip with a link beside it, a row of step segments, a
 * draft line, and then, at the bottom of whichever step was open, that step's
 * own pair of buttons. Every strip was added by the release that needed it and
 * none of them knew about the others, so the first screenful of a shipment was
 * mostly chrome and the button that moves you forward sat wherever the step
 * happened to end.
 *
 * This is one header and one action bar instead:
 *
 * - **The header** says which shipment this is, what has happened to it (the
 *   draft line), where you are in it (the steps) and which transport mode it
 *   is being entered for — the mode as a *switcher*, not a chooser. Choosing
 *   where to begin is `/`, and it stays there; this changes the mode of the
 *   shipment already in front of you.
 * - **The action bar** is `sticky bottom-0`, not `fixed`, and the difference
 *   is worth being exact about because it was measured. A sticky bar is still
 *   in the layout: it takes its own height at the end of the page, so the last
 *   row of a long form — and the error standing next to it — is never left
 *   underneath it. A fixed bar is out of the layout and covers that last row
 *   permanently, with no scroll position that reveals it. What sticky does not
 *   claim is that it never overlaps anything at all: while you are scrolled
 *   above its resting place it floats over what is behind it, the way every
 *   bar of this kind does. That overlap is transient and one scroll away; the
 *   one a fixed bar creates is not.
 *
 * Steps render their buttons through `WizardActions`, which puts them in the
 * bar. Rendered without a shell around it — as the steps' own tests do — it
 * falls back to a plain row in place, so a component stays testable on its own.
