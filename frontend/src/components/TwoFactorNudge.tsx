/**
 * A reminder, once per sign-in, for an account without a second factor.
 *
 * A password alone is one leaked reuse away from somebody else drawing up
 * consignment papers in your name. This is the gentlest thing that still
 * works: a snackbar that names the gap and offers the button that closes it,
 * rather than a screen the user has to get past before they can work.
 *
 * Three decisions worth stating, because each could reasonably have gone the
 * other way:
 *
 * - **It stays until it is closed.** It carries an action, and an action that
 *   slides away after four seconds is a button nobody clicks. It is an `info`
 *   toast rather than a `question`, because there is no wrong answer here —
 *   "not now" is a legitimate one and costs a single click.
 * - **It comes back next sign-in.** The marker sits in `sessionStorage` and is
 *   cleared on logout, so refreshing the page mid-work does not renew the
 *   nudge, while the next sign-in does. Nagging on every render would train
 *   people to dismiss it unread, which is worse than not asking.
 * - **The button goes to the panel, not to the page.** `/settings?tab=details`
 *   opens the tab the second factor actually lives on. Landing on the theme
 *   settings with the panel three tabs away is not an answer to the notice
 *   the user just clicked.
 *
 * Nothing is shown when the status cannot be fetched: a backend that will not
 * answer is not evidence that the account is unprotected.
 *
 * Since v1.190.0 the server enforces a required factor on every call rather
 * than mentioning it at sign-in, and answers everything but the panel's own
 * routes with `auth.two_factor_required`. The API client raises that as a
 * window event; this component is where it lands, because it is mounted for
 * every signed-in user and already knows the way to the panel. The person
 * is taken there and told why, once — the refused call's own error toast
 * says the rest.
