/**
 * What the shipment adds up to, standing beside the work instead of waiting
 * at the end of it.
 *
 * Two things were true before this and neither was good. The counts — lines,
 * weight, volume, warnings — were four cards on the goods step and nowhere
 * else, so the moment you moved to the questions the totals you were entering
 * against went off the screen. And the documents being prepared were only
 * visible on the step that asks their questions, so on the goods step nobody
 * could see what all this typing was *for*.
 *
 * Both live here now, on every step: the four numbers, and the document set
 * with what each one is still waiting for. A document that is short of an
 * answer says how many and takes you to the first of them — the same jump
 * release 111 built for the export step's chips, from a place you pass much
 * earlier.
 *
 * **Where it stands.** A right-hand column from `xl` up, sticky so it stays
 * with you; below that, a card above the work. The goods list is a row of
 * fields that wraps rather than a fixed table, so taking 18rem off it on a
 * wide screen costs nothing — measured at 1440, where the row is still one
 * line. Under `xl` there is not that much to spare, and the panel goes back to
 * being what it always was: a strip above the list.
