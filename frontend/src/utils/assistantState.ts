 * Whatever these two functions do not carry is silently forgotten between
 * turns. That is not theoretical: the skipped questions were not carried,
 * so every "skip" was forgotten the moment the next answer was sent — and
 * the same optional question came back after every turn, swallowing whatever
 * was typed as an answer to it.
